From [siamagazin](http://siamagazin.com/this-guy-uses-a-hand-cranked-pasta-machine-to-duplicate-a-photo/) :
> YouTuber Kensuke Koike demonstrated a really intelligent collage trick with a hand-cranked pasta machine and a photograph of a canine. After sending the photograph via the pasta machine, he organized the ensuing strips into a reproduction of the identical photograph.

> He then put these two photographs collectively, despatched them again via the pasta machine and created 4 of the identical photographs from the strips.
